## General methods of preparation of aldehydes and ketones A. Preparation of aldehydes and ketones


**1.) Oxidation and catalytic dehydrogenation of alcohols** We have already learnt that the oxidation of primary alcohol gives aldehydes and secondary

alcohol gives a ketone. Oxidising agents such as acidified Na Cr O KMnO PCC2 2 7 4, , are used for oxidation. Oxidation using PCC yield aldehydes . Other oxidising agents further oxidise the aldhydes / ketones in to carboxylic acids (Refer Unit No. - 11 Oxidation of alcohols)

When vapours of alcohols are passed over heavy metal catalyst such as Cu, Ag, alcohols give aldehydes and ketons. (Refer Unit No. - 11 Catalytic dehydrogenation of alcohols **2.) Ozonolysis of alkenes**

We have already learnt in XI th standard that the reductive ozonolysis of alkenes gives aldehydes and ketones.

Alkenes react with ozone to form ozonide which on subsequent cleavage with zinc and water gives aldehydes and ketones. Zinc dust removes H2O2 formed, which otherwise can oxidise aldehydes / ketones.

**3\. Hydration of alkynes** We have already learnt in XI standard that the hydration of alkynes in presence of 40%

dilute sulpuric acid and 1% HgSO4 to give the corresponding aldehydes / ketones.

**a) Hydration of acetylene yields acetaldehyde**

**4\. From calcium salts of carboxylic acids** Aldehydes and ketones may be prepared by the dry distillation of calcium salts of carboxylic

acids.

**a)** **Aldehydes** are obtained when the mixture of calcium salt of carboxylic acid and calcium formate is subjected to dry distillation.

**B. Preparation of aldehydes**

**1) Rosenmund reduction a)** **Aldehydes** can be prepared by the hydrogenation of acid chloride, in the presence of

palladium supported by barium sulphate. This reaction is called Rosenmund reduction.

**Example**

CH3 C Cl + H2 CH3 C H + HCl

O O Pd/ BaSO4

Acetyl chloride Acetaldehyde

In this reaction, barium sulphate act as a catalytic poison to palladium catalyst, so that aldehyde cannot be further reduced to alcohol.

Formaldehyde and ketones cannot be prepared by this method.

**2\. Stephen's reaction** When alkylcyanides are reduced using SnCl / HCl2 , imines are formed, which on

hydrolysis gives corresponding aldehyde. +

**3\. Selective reduction of cyanides** Diisobutyl aluminium hydride (DIBAL –H) selectively reduces the alkyl cyanides to form

imines which on hydrolysis gives aldehydes.

**C) Preparation of benzaldehyde**

**1\. Side chain oxidation of toluene and its derivatives** by strong oxidising agents such as KMnO4 gives benzoic acid.

When chromylchloride is used as an oxidising agent, toluene gives benzaldehyde. This reaction is called **Etard reaction**. Acetic anhydride and CrO3 can also be used for this reaction.

Oxidation of toluene by chromic oxide gives benzylidine diacetate which on hydrolysis gives benzaldehyde.

**2) Gattermann – Koch reaction** This reaction is a variant of Friedel – Crafts acylation reaction. In this method, reaction of

carbon monoxide and HCl generate an intermediate which reacts like formyl chloride.

It is the best method for preparing alkyl aryl ketones or diaryl ketones. This reaction succeeds only with benzene and activated benzene derivatives.
